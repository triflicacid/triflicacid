### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ruben

Welcome to my personal GitHub, a collection of random personal projects I have built over the years.
Explore a variety of topics and see what I was, and currently am, interested in.
Hopefully one interests you!
Most repos had short and fast development cycles, but there are a few that I work on sporadically still.

My personal favourites are:
- `ts-smilesParser` - I made this during Chemistry A-level to visualise chemical structures, as well as help learn organic reaction pathways.
- `js-logicGates` - This is a newer version of a simplilar application I made during GCSE to help with the visualisation of logic gates, giving me a playground to explore circuits. It was also one of my first UI-heavy applications.
- `js-decayLab` - An application that allows the construction of radioactive samples with a variety of isotopes, I made this while I was studying isotopes and radioactive decay. I really like how I can throw a few isotopes together, simulate time advancing and see what I have left and what statistics the application has collated along the way.
- `ts-aqaVirtualMachine` - Originally written during Computer Science A-level to more fully understand the AQA assembly language, it grew into an adaptable assembler and CPU emulator which supports different CPUs. The UI has tabs which allows you to write and compile assembly code, as well as de-compile, view memory and registers, step-through execution with a table commenting executed instructions, and the ability to load, read and write files to and from memory.
